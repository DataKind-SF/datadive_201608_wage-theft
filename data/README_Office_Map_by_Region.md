Here’s another small dataset that would be useful for the internal analysis – it maps counties to Wage and Hour District Offices. That way, when talking about the results of analysis, in addition to talking about differences between counties, states, etc., you could talk about difference between District Offices (DOs), and conclusions that would be specific to DOs (i.e. this DO has a high portion of employees in industry X, when cases are done in that industry there are high amounts of back wages found due, including high minimum wage violations, BUT the DO is not doing very many cases indicating a possible area where they could do more cases).
